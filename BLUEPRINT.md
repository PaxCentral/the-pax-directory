INTRODUCTION

Pax is a virtual nation and peer to peer legal system powered by Ethereum. Its mission is to provide a truly global and voluntary civic operating system and a methodology for decentralized order, trust and cooperation. The starting point will be a web of template smart contracts which will notarize a whole range of essential legal relationships on the Ethereum blockchain, along with a platform for resolving disputes. This Blueprint will describe these relationships and the structures that form Pax as a whole.

LAW AND CODE

The basic philsophy underlying Pax Directory is the difference between formal Law and informal Code. Law is universifiable to all moral agents: respect for consent, property rights and bodily autonomy. This markedly different than a legal philosophy based on the authority of a particular government, which passses hundreds of thousands of arbitrary dictates and calls them "laws". Under Pax, only rules that can be logically universalized can be called Law. Many of the "laws" put forward by the state require the state itself to break the Law in order to enforce it- for example, the invasion of property rights through taxation in order to enforce higher level rules.

"Code" is what Pax calls these higher level rules which can be adopted by claves by consent of the governed, to make life more convenient. Code is subject to exit rights. An individual who has entered the jurisdiction of a clave and can exit at any time. In this way the structure of Pax induces competition and experimentation, and allows for a wider variation of ideologies to co-exist peacefully. As an obvious analogy, it could be said that one is agreeing to the jurisdiction of a certain website, but you are free to opt-out if the policies of the website are intolerable.

THE DIRECTORY

The Pax Directory is a cryptographically secure identity system, reputation system and localized civic network. There are three levels of status within the Directory, which are correlated with trust and reputation.

- Client
- Citizen
- Jurist

PAX CLIENTS

A Client of Pax can register their identity in the system as they are, without any proof- in much the same way that one can register a social media account. This is the basic starting point that allows the client to commit basic smart contract templates, to get employed by a Pax company or to incorporate a company within the network.

CITIZENSHIP AND PEER TO PEER VALIDATION

To attain the identity-level of Pax Citizen (or “peer”), you must be vouched for by three other people who have Citizen status. To create a new “citizen account” the three peers must initiate a Multisig permission contract from their account in order to vouch for the person (who will have already registered as a client on the Directory).  This creates a dynamic where people are encouraged to integrate socially with other citizens, while avoiding Orwellian biometrics or other centralized and intrusive procedures for verifying identity. The status system within the Directory interface is designed to weed out dishonest actors. Peer validation is the methodology for many permissions required on the Directory.

JURISTS

A jurist is a citizen with the highest trust level, and has the ability to start claves and vote on Cases. The procedure to attain this status is peer to peer validation by nine other citizens as well as the completion of certain modules on Pax Academy.

CLAVES

A clave is the basic civic unit of Pax. Claves are local and territorial in nature, but not exclusively. While the Pax Directory will have all the features of a social network, it is geared toward face to face networking. “Hubs” can be created by claves within their local communities as a point of contact if there is the will and the resources available among the citizens themselves. A clave contract on the Directory is formed by peer to peer validation of three Jurists.

MARRIAGES

A Pax Marriage is a contract between two citizens that allows them to own a Deed as one name, as well as any other particular agreements that they opt into for themselves as part of their own contract, which can be customized. Any children that are born to parents of this status are automatically Pax Citizens. The peer validation procedure for a Marriage is that each partner must be validated by one other, and the marriage is confirmed by a Jurist.

PAX ACADEMY

This is both an educational platform and a Blockchain-based credential system which could be used by MOOC’s and brick and mortar institutions to prove education levels. This will have a lot of direct value now that many online forms of education are not currently acknowledged as holding the same validity as traditional degrees. Pax Academy will change that. Clients and citizens can increase their status by engaging with the Academy.

MUTUAL LIABILITY COMPANIES

Organizations that wish to have a legal existence on the blockchain can incorporate on Pax. This gives them a whole range of benefits and protections, including self-executing smart contracts underlying transactions, dispute resolution that is considerably more efficient and inexpensive than the nation-state alternative, which can be very costly for large companies. Within the directory interface it will be possible to add “employees”- registered as Pax clients (or citizens) on the network, similar to a Facebook group. The traditional model of incorporation- limited liability companies- limits the liability of a company so that the owners are not personally liable. This is flawed and creates a whole host of incentive problems, where companies are incentivized to engage in much more risky behaviour than what they otherwise would.

Therefore the model of incorporation that Pax will follow is Mutual Liability, where liability is limited by the network only to the degree that a certain amount of the equity of the company is owned by a public share pool of the Network. The proportion of equity of Pax companies that is owned by the commons will be kept at a competitive rate, lower than nation-state corporation tax (or other decentralized civic networks which adopt the same model). This public share pool, implemented by a smart contract, becomes the basis of a basic income called “divs” which is distributed equally among all Pax Citizens.

THE FORA

The Fora will be the Pax equivalent of an “App Store”- a marketplace of enterprises and civic enterprises. This has a particular advantage in that the provision of certain fundamental services- security, justice etc. do not have to be provided by Pax in a centralized fashion, but can be created by citizens according to a certain methodology and held to a reputational standard. The reputation system within Pax will be called “status”, and applies both to citizens and enterprises. The advantage is that enterprises, including civic enterprises, exist according to supply and demand. The current legal system is formed by monopoly and limited provision, which is one of the reasons why the legal process is so expensive.

CASES

Cases is the methodology according to which disputes that arise among individuals and companies on the directory will be resolved. This can be initiated on the Directory if there is a dispute about a smart contract. Dispute resolution enterprises on the Pax Fora can come to resolutions on cases, the results of which are recorded on Ethereum in the public domain. The model of justice employed within Pax is Restorative Justice, where a guilty defendant is put in debt to the plaintiff in the form of a smart contract according to the judgement. If there is a failure to honor the contract it could lead to reputational consequences of Exit if serious enough.

TREATIES

Treaties are agreements, written in Codex that exist between multiple claves on issues of agreement or with bodies external to Pax, such as nation states or other civic networks. For example in a dense city, multiple claves could agree to certain codes for convenience.

EXIT: HONORABLE AND DISHONORABLE

The moral imperative underlying Pax as a whole is the concept of exit rights. This is the belief that consent should be at the heart of all personal and civic arrangements. Contracts can be entered into voluntarily, but can also be left. As someone can join a particular clave, they are also free to leave it. The lack of freedom of exit is one of the reasons why nation state monopolies are so dysfunctional in the 21st century.

There are two kinds of Exit within Pax: honorable and dishonorable Exit. A citizen is free to leave the jurisdiction of Pax at any time, and have this notarized on the blockchain as an honorable Exit. Freedom of association or disassociation is currently the norm in almost every domain of life except for the glaring exception of civic institutions. Pax intends to change that culture for good, and implement the tools for a true opt-in society.

Dishonorable Exit from the Directory can result as the consequence of very serious Cases, or where there has been repeated violations of Law or Code. This could mean expulsion from a clave or expulsion from the directory as a whole, depending on the seriousness of the offence. In general the goal would be
